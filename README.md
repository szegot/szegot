# Tibor Szeg≈ë
Welcome to my page, my name is Tibor and I'm a fresh alumni of Green Fox Academy.
<br/>
I would like to deepen my knowledge acquired as a Full-Stack developer at the Green Fox Academy so that I can further shape my skills over time and use them as a data specialist.
<br/>
Prior to joining Green Fox academy I worked in the printing and signage industry. During my professional career as project manager, I gained experience in product management and maintaining relationships with the company's customers. I have always strived to acquire broad knowledge and I feel that programming opens up new and exciting areas for me.
